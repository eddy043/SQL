My SQL portfolio will showcase projects involving database design, advanced querying, and data transformation (ETL). I will demonstrate skills in optimizing query performance and creating reports using SQL-driven data. Additionally, Iâ€™ll highlight tasks related to database management and security across platforms like MySQL and PostgreSQL. Feel free to reach out with any questions you may have.
